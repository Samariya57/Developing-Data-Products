If you have to study something hard you really need some quite places near where you live. Libraries are such good places to think! 
Here is my list of favorite Columbia University Libraries.
```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
libNames <- c("Avery", "Barnard","Business","Butler","Math")
df <- data.frame(lat=40.808381, lng=-73.960884)
newrow=c(40.809097, -73.963939)
df = rbind(df,newrow)
newrow=c(40.809231, -73.961147)
df = rbind(df,newrow)
newrow=c(40.806422, -73.963225)
df = rbind(df,newrow)
newrow=c(40.808988, -73.962783)
df = rbind(df,newrow)
df %>% 
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(popup=libNames)

```
